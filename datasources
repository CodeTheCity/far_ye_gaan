Suggestions
Bus operators - suggest adding a bus gate
Freight Action Plan Implementation Group (FAPIG) - should segregate cyclists from other road users
Shell Bike User Group / Aberdeen Cycle Forum - A cycle route parallel to Wellington Road may be a better option than trying to accommodate cyclists alongside other road users particularly in the “uphill”direction.
Kincorth and Leggart Community Council - Bus lane would mean cars are limited to one lane, and road would needed widened, more people would use the bus if the service provided was improved
Cove and Altens Community Council - buses often have difficulty accessing the bus lane, buses often sit and wait at stops in order to keep to schedule
Nestrans - Main problem with both walking and cycling is perceived safety from the close proximity to relatively high levels of HGVs.
Online survey - additional road lanes was ranked as the mostimportant priority

Talks about Option 1: Strategic Cycle Improvements, Option 2: Shared Bus / HGV Priority Lane, and Option 7: Wellington Road Bus Quality Package
