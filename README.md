# Far Ye Gaan

A CTC17 team looking at improving travel in Aberdeen by finding which routes are in most need of improvement

## The Problem

Many people travel several miles to work every day. Ideally, they would have access to efficient public transport (of safe active travel routes) that are comparable in convenience to private car usage. In practice, public transport options are often much slower than travelling by private car. 

## Goal of this project

The goal of this project is simply to identify the routes where the greatest improvement could be realised. This involves identifying routes where the greatest discepancy exists between private and public travel times. This will be done for routes between the most populous places where people live and key employment locations such as industrial estates.

# Handy resources

This image illlustrates the typical differences between travel times by different modes. The red area shows the limits of where you can travel within 30 minutes starting from the centre of Mannofield. The blue area shows the destinations possible by car within 30 minutes from the same starting point.
