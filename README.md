## The Problem

Many people travel several miles to work every day. Ideally, they would have access to efficient public transport (of safe active travel routes) that are comparable in convenience to private car usage. In practice, public transport options are often much slower than travelling by private car.

_Red: population centres, Blue: industrial locations, Green: retail locations_

We identified a set of locations marked as population hotspots and compared these with locations of locations of heavy industry and centres of large-scale employment - when considering that _all_ bus routes travel through the city centre, making short journeys from suburb to suburb very lengthy - a full hour longer in some cases. 

## Goal of this project

The goal of this project is simply to identify the routes where the greatest improvement could be realised. This involves identifying routes where the greatest discepancy exists between private and public travel times. This will be done for routes between the most populous places where people live and key employment locations such as industrial estates.

# Handy resources

This image illlustrates the typical differences between travel times by different modes. The red area shows the limits of where you can travel within 30 minutes starting from the centre of Mannofield. The blue area shows the destinations possible by car within 30 minutes from the same starting point.
